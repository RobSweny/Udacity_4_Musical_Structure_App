# Android Basics Nanodegree - Project 4 Music Player

This is a very basic structure of a music player app.
It has a menu, and from the menu you can access a list of songs.
This list of songs has titles and artist names, but doesn't play any music.
I modelled this application from the Spotify Application.

This project utilizes the following:

* onClick listeners
* ListView
* Menu with TextViews and dividers
